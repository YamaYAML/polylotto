# Polygon Lottery DApp

This is a decentralized lottery application (DApp) developed on the Polygon network. Participants can enter the lottery by depositing a minimum of 0.01 MATIC. The contract owner can then call the function to pick a winner, which will be selected through a secure random number generated by Chainlink VRF.
